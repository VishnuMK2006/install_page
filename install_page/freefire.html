            [New Event - The Chaos]
With the new event comes an exciting mechanism where players can vote for bizarre incidents to happen in the matches. Anything is possible - out-of-control airplane routes, genetically modified mushrooms, unusual Airdrop mechanisms... Seriously, anything!

[NexTerra 2.0]
Zipway's terrain and artistic elements have been reworked, making the area much easier to loot in the new version and earning it a place in the CS-Ranked map pool.
The desert plains surrounding Deca Square and Mortar Ruins have been replaced by greenery and structures, expanding their lootable range.
There is also a bunch of other map-balancing adjustments for you to explore. Plus, the file size of NexTerra has been significantly reduced, so it now takes up much less device storage.

[New Character]
Ryden, the 16-year-old inventive genius, releases a robotic spider that limits enemy movement and inflicts damage over time.

Free Fire is a world-famous survival shooter game available on mobile. Each 10-minute game places you on a remote island where you are pit against 49 other players, all seeking survival. Players freely choose their starting point with their parachute, and aim to stay in the safe zone for as long as possible. Drive vehicles to explore the vast map, hide in the wild, or become invisible by proning under grass or rifts. Ambush, snipe, survive, there is only one goal: to survive and answer the call of duty.

Free Fire, Battle In Style!
